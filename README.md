## Base Classes

All classes that are prefixed with `Base` are `Boilerplate`-classes that extend an `Abstract`-class and include some `Traits` that are commonly used. So the `Base`-classes can be used to prevent building a `BaseRepository`, `BasePresenter` or whatever for each project.

## To-Do

- Update DocBlocks
- Add documentation for Traits
